# WEB 330 Enterprise JavaScript II

## Course Description
Master JavaScript by learning and solving real-world problems.  This course continues where the 
introductory JavaScript course left off.  Students use a wide range of JavaScript programming
strategies to build interactive programs.  Topics include object-oriented programming, unit testing,
asynchronous executions, files and streams, lambda expressions, and module bundlers.  Problem solving 
using advanced JavaScript techniques is emphasized.  GitHub is used to host and share coding projects.
