## Course Description
Master JavaScript by learning and solving real-world problems.  This course continues where the
introductory JavaScript course left off.  Students use a wide range of JavaScript programming
strategies to build interactive programs.  Topics include object-oriented programming, unit testing,
asynchronous executions, files and streams, lambda expressions, and module bundlers.  Problem solving
using advanced JavaScript techniques is emphasized.  GitHub is used to host and share coding projects.

## Course Prerequisites
WEB 200 and WEB 231

## Course Skills
* Develop programs using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS to meet project requirements.
* Utilize effective time management and task prioritization techniques to meet project obligations.

## Course Objectives
Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:
* Apply object-oriented programming concepts to solve complex problems.
* Develop programs using JavaScript classes and static functions.
* Experiment with JavaScript Iterators and Generators.
* Utilize market research to design UI/UX prototypes.
* Build dynamic HTML using JavaScript and Web Components.
* Make use of asynchronous executions to load dynamic datasets.

## Repository Overview

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code, so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.
